# Studying-differences-in-mutability-between-parental-sets-of-chromosomes
Different genomes (i.e. sets of chromosomes) differ at many positions in sequence and genomic structure. Both characteristics, especially the latter (chromatin state), are known to impact mutation rates in our tissues, but how much of a difference does it make between parental sets of chromosomes?

### Planning
__Step 1__: PCA of SNPs from the 1000 Genome project (SNPs on exons that are present in
PCAWG( is the buca patients etc â€¦)) and projections of SNPs from PCAWG onto the
principal components calculated on the 1000 Genome project. -> Allows identification
of mixed ancestry samples in PCAWG.
Step 2: For 1 mixed ancestry sample, phase the SNPs to an ancestry by blocks of 500,000
bases (you may have to play with the window size later).
Step 3: For this sample, phase the SNVs to the SNPs and thus to the ancestry.
Step 4: Generate graphs or statistics on the somatic mutation rate on each parental copy
for this sample.
