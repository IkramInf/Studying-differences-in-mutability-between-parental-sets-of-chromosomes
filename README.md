# Studying-differences-in-mutability-between-parental-sets-of-chromosomes
Different genomes (i.e. sets of chromosomes) differ at many positions in sequence and genomic structure. Both characteristics, especially the latter (chromatin state), are known to impact mutation rates in our tissues, but how much of a difference does it make between parental sets of chromosomes?
